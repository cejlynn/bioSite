  <h1>Fishing</h1>
  <p> In her spare time, Valerie loves to fish. Since moving to Alaska, she has spent a lot of time fishing. In her second year of living in Alaska, she and her husband Scott learned of dip-netting, which is where you use a net and stand in the water to catch fish, and tried it. Valerie immediately fell in love with it and has continued to do it when it is in season. She has caught salmon and most recently, halibut.  </p>

<div class="hobby2"><h1>Hobby 2</h1>
  <p> For those who are unaware what quail are, they are little birds that are closely related to chickens, pheasants, ptarmigans, partridges, and more. They vary in size, shape, and color depending on the species. There are at least 43 different species of these birds and most of them are cryptic colored or colored to match their environment. Valerie discovered these birds and decided that it would be a great idea to raise them for not only their eggs, but also to help train her bird dogs. </p>

<div class="hobby3"><h1>Training Her Bird Dogs</h1>
  <p> In December 2020, she and her husband Scott decided to bring home another dog, a Vizsla named Ember. Vizslaâ€™s are short-coated hunting dogs that come from Hungary. They are lively, gentle-mannered, extremely affectionate, and protective over their chosen family. Valerie has become committed in training Ember to become a model bird dog and loves it when she reaches milestones with Ember. They are two peas in a pod, always side by side with each other.  </p>
