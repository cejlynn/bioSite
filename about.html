  <h1>About</h1>
  <p> Valerie Wright was born on February 8th in Westerly, Rhode Island to Dale and Linda Barber. Since her father was in the U.S Navy, it meant her family moved around a lot and it wasnâ€™t until she was in seventh grade that they eventually made a permanent residence in Mississippi. At 21, she joined the U.S Navy to become a hospital corpsman. She met Dale Johnson at her first duty station in Portsmouth, Virginia and the two got married. She had twins, Luke, and Jared, before moving to Florida where she had another son, Austin. Valerie stayed in Florida for 3 years before she packed up and moved her family to Texas, where she eventually gave birth to a daughter who she named Caitlynne. 5 years passed before she and her family moved to North Carolina. Valerie and Dale divorced and continued to co-parent their children together. During their separation, Valerie met Scott Wright on eHarmony, a dating site. It was clear to them that there was a special connection with each other, and they got together. A few months later, Valerie, Scott, and her children moved to Brunswick, Maryland where they got married on December 22, 2006. Moving to Hagerstown, Maryland a year later, Valerie and her family stayed there until all her children graduated high school. During that time, she retired from the U.S Navy in 2011 and took a position in the Army as a civilian. In 2019, Valerie got the opportunity of a lifetime to move to Alaska and work for the Army up there. Now in 2022, she is living the dream and almost has her dream house completed.  </p>
